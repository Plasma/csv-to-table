# Change Log

### 1.2.3
Trivial performance improvement during table generation.

### 1.2.2
Added a new option that is off by default, to transform the first row (header) values to upper-case, to make the column headers stand out.

This option can be changed via Extension settings.

Added option to specify a custom separator ("Convert to table from a custom defined separator" command).

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the extension.
